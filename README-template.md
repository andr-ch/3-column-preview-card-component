### What I Learned

### What I Learned

1. **Using Bootstrap to style and layout the content:**
a.**Implemented a responsive layout using Bootstrap's grid system (container-fluid, row, col-md-4) to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes:**
```html
<main class="container-fluid bg-main">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="car1-section col-md-4">
            <!-- Content for Sedans -->
        </div>
        <div class="car2-section col-md-4">
            <!-- Content for SUVs -->
        </div>
        <div class="car3-section col-md-4">
            <!-- Content for Luxury cars -->
        </div>
    </div>
</main>
```
b.*Utilized the `bg-main` class to create a spacious main content section:**
 ```css
.bg-main {
    padding: 12rem 3rem;
}
```

c.**Styled buttons for improved visual appeal:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-lg btn-outline-light rounded-pill learn-more-button" type="button">Learn More</button>
```
    Here I used:
    - `btn-lg`: Increases button size for better visibility.
    - `btn-outline-light`: Creates a light outlined border for clarity.
    - `rounded-pill`: Applies rounded corners to the button.

2. **Styling and creating create a flexible, rounded container:**
 ```css
.row {
    max-width: 55%;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;
}
```
    Here I used:
- `max-width: 55%`: Ensures the container adapts to different screen sizes but doesn't exceed a certain width.
- `border-radius: 10px`: Applies rounded corners to the container.
- `overflow: hidden`: Hides any content that exceeds the specified dimensions of the container and uses flexbox for layout flexibility.
- `display: flex`: Enables flex container properties for easier alignment of child elements.

3. **Using flex properties for responsive and centered layouts:**
 ```css
.container-fluid {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
Here I used: 
- `flex-wrap: wrap`: Allows items to wrap to the next line when necessary.
- `justify-content: center` and `align-items: center`: Centers items horizontally and vertically within the container.
